# Reaction Networks

Source code for my master thesis of chemical reaction networks. 
This Readme is in progress.

## How it works?

Open `julia` and type
```
using IJulia
notebook()
```
Then a Jupyter notebook should apear and you
can find the key points in the script `examples/abc/ABC_Numerics.ipynb`
